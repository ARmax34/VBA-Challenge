# VBA-Challenge
Module 2 Challenge for Georgia Tech Bootcamp


The instructions For the Activity
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Instructions

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

**Note:** Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

The result should match the following image:

![moderate_solution](Images/moderate_solution.png)

## Bonus

Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:

![hard_solution](Images/hard_solution.png)

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to allow it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) just by running the VBA script once.

## Other Considerations

* Use the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing your code. This data set is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3 to 5 minutes.

* Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with one click of a button.

* Some assignments, like this one, contain a bonus. It is possible to achieve proficiency for this assignment without completing the bonus. The bonus is an opportunity to further develop your skills and be rewarded extra points for doing so.

## Submission

To submit, please upload the following to GitHub:

  * A screen shot for each year of your results on the multi-year stock data.

  * VBA scripts as separate files.

Be sure to commit regularly to your repository and that it contains a README.md file.

After saving your work, create a shareable link and submit the link to <https://bootcampspot-v2.com/>.

The Layout and Design of this project can be broken up into different sections

To begin the code is layed out to start with a For Each loop to allow the program to loop through each worksheet. Due to this need to incorperate every file in this subroutine, this loop was designated as the outer most loop to allow all the internal code to be run for each worksheet before moving on to the next sheet.

Next is the loading of strings into specific cells that will act as the labeling of headers for the data. This is more for cosmetics and proper labeling for the more traditional side of excel.
    
    
An improtent next step was the establishment of key variables and providing them with specific values at this point. This segment allowed for these variables to also reset so that each sheet will start with the desired values.

A row counter was also created for the main body of data so that the later nested For Loop will be able to have a specific endpoint that will adapt to any amount of data reguardless of which sheet it is on.

That previously mentioned For loop is now running and is promarily dominated by the if statement within it. This if statement is broken up where the logic path is dictated by weather the next cell (that contains the stock ticker) is the same as the one where the for loop is at.

    if they match: 
        the value of the volume is collected and added to the running total.

    if it does not match: 
        The seconday table starts to become filled with values.
        The closing cost gets captured as a variable.
        The yearly change is calculated.
            Receives formating
        The percentage change gets calculated.
            Receives formating
        The open value gets re-entered with the following rows open value.
            To be reseted for the next cycle by entering in the next tickers value
            Which is why it is placed at the end of the sequence
        The Volume data gets dumped in a cell and gets reset

Outside the first nested For loop is a second nested For loop that exists on the same level as the first nested For loop.
    This is done in this way to allow for the data to finish creating the main table, which is what the second nested loop will use.

Like the first nested loop, there is a counter of rows variable and a loading of externally created variable before the loop is created.
    The counter variable is counting the rows of the main table that was just created by the first nested loop.

This second nested For loop has three If Statements that are compareing the values of the main table in order to get the appropriate values for the second table.
    In contrast to the main table, the secondary table is more blunt in its approach, due to the requirments and less date that needs to be sorted through.

The If statement is closed up, the For loop ends, and the subroutine moves on to the next worksheet.

The subroutine ends when the last sheet is through being processed.
